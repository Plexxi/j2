/*
  a.b.c  -> name
  a.b,c  -> 2nd index?
  !5  -> run 5 times
  !name  -> map to items in name, i.e. *name

  a.*.c  -> search for matches, i.e. [a.*.c] $
  a.b.c -> [x]
  a.b.* -> [[x] [y] [z]]
  a.*.* -> [[[d] [e] [f]]  [[g] [h] [i]]  [[j] [k] [l]]

  need syntax for stack vs. queue naming  1@a  vs. 2$b?
