J2 is a minimalist programming language that makes up for its simplicity
by having the built-in ability to understand and dynamically bind with C
binaries, transparently.

I.e. no wrappers necessary.

It's not there yet but the path is clear... (It's not named "J2" without
reason, this is a ground-up rewrite geared towards addressing the performance
issues of the 1st generation of this project.)

This project is licensed under the GPLv3, including the conveniently included
linux rbtree sources, myreader.c (derived from libdwarf's "simplereader.c")
and binutils' dwarf.c (which is just for my own reference.)
